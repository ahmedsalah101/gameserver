# Description

a game server using the Actor model, a concurrency model that allows for efficient and scalable system design. The server utilizes websockets to synchronize the state of multiple players in real-time, providing a smooth gaming experience.
By leveraging the Actor model, the game server is able to handle high loads and efficiently coordinate shared state between all players. This approach ensures high performance and responsiveness in the game environment.

## Running Server

```
make server
```

this will start the server on port 4000,and will wait for clients to syncronize states among them.

## Running Clients

start clients by running:

```
make client
```

## Example

```
‚ùØ make server
TRAC[0000] [INBOX] started                               pid=local/server
starting HTTP server on port 4000
TRAC[0000] [PROCESS] started                             pid=local/server
server !
```

on shell 1: run `make client`
on shell 2: run `make client`

server:

```
